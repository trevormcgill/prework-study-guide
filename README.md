# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I learned the basics of web development by building a web-based study guide that involved HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I started with HTML to structure the website, then used CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and Git for version control. This project gave me hands-on experience with these essential web technologies and helped establish a strong foundation for future learning.
